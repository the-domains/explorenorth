About

Explore North will take you into one of the most beautiful areas in the world. We will let you climb to the summit of mountains that starts right at the beach and ski or walk down again. Or we can take you sailing in the Lofoten archipelago where the midnight sun never sets. We do skippered expeditions and if you need expert guiding in the mountain, we have a number of the best mountain guides in Norway to choose from .

Through our network we also offer bare boat charter all along the coast.

Explore Norths playground is between Bergen and Spitsbergen. Either you want to treat your employees, business partners, friends or family to something extra -- we have the tools and the local knowledge to give you an experience of a lifetime. We can show you some of the world's most stunning cruising grounds, and when you combine sailing with skiing and/or hiking you end up with one of the most perfect combinations in the world.

We can set you up with a bare boat charter deal, take you on a skippered boat of your choice, be guides aboard your own boat or manage the whole expedition from our offices so that you get a safe and adventurous experience.
