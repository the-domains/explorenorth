Guidelines for Antarctica
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f8778b13-53fb-48ae-ba71-2c545da63bac.jpg)

Planing to sail to Anractica? IAATO has just release a short animated briefing to supplement the existing [Mandatory Briefing][0]_Visitors Guide to the Antarctic_ which is presented by IAATO operators to guests and crew before arriving in Antarctica to make them aware of necessary safety and environmental requirements. 

[Briefing Film - Going Ashore Visitors (English)][1] from [IAATO][2] on [Vimeo][3].

One can wonder why they have used a rather boring animation to illustrate the guidelines, but the answer may be exactly that: Boring.

If they had used footage from Antarctica the viewer might just get distracted from the message in the video.
