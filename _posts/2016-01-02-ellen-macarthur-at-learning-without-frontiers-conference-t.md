Ellen MacArthur is a huge inspiration, and I even had the chance to meet her when we invited her to hold a lecture in Norway. I have also written the last chapter in the Norwegian edition of her biography _Taking on the world_. She definitely took on the world with her circumnavigations, and now, with the same force and dreams, she is fighting for a better and greener world. Inspiration in the pures form. Go, Ellen.
