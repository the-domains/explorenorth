If you blink you will walk straight past it. But sailors don't blink, do they? In 194 Shaftsbury Aveny, London there is a cosy and well stocked marine chandlery. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cc08d8d5-5ffd-4e3f-8e43-0d9206737100.jpg)

It is filled from roof to the cracked wooden floor with Devold knitted sweaters, Danish ships bisqiuts, shakles, knives and books. All the real sailors need, and then some.

Behind the counter there is a young and keen staff who are more than willing to help you out. Even picky super yacht skippers call Arthur Beale when they need some special items. Service is everything.

I'm very proud to say that they now also have [_High Latitude Sailing - How to sail the cold waters of the world_][0] in stock. They are even planning to have a High Latitude Sailing seminar in February. We will publish more on that when we get information. Stay tuned.
