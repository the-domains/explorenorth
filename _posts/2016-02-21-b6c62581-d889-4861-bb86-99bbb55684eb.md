**The beauty of home**

When the
sun climbed over the white capped mountains and cast it's warm beams on the
mirror like fjord for the third May day in a row, it hit me: I have the most
beautiful cruising in my own back yard. S/Y Explore North is cruising the west
coast of Norway.

****

**Words: Jon Amtrup, skipper S/Y Explore North**

There is
very few places in the world where you can sail in to the foot of snow covered
mountains in shorts, put on your skies after a few hundred meters of walking,
climb up 1564 meters to get a fantastic view and then ski back down to the boat
again.

In
Hjørundfjorden, Norway you can. Explore North, a 2008 modell Ovni 435, is
equipped for high latitude expeditions with Raymarine equipment all over, wind
generator, extra diesel and water capacity, three separate heating
arrangements, and with oak interior and aluminum hull and deck to keep impact
on nature low. 

We picked
up the boat in Les Sables d'Olonne in April 2008 and had a fantastic shake down
cruise back home to Norway. The weather was fantastic and the people we meet
inviting. The harbors we visited gave us good memories along the way. But we
wanted to get home and to the west coast of Norway. There I knew the real adventure
waited.

The reason
is simple -- and I think this applies to most people: We almost always look
beyond our own borders when we seek the perfect holiday. But if you bother to
check out your own back yard, you most likely will find it a paradise if you
like the combination of sea and mountains. I know I did, but the English
discovered it first.

_- The wildest
alpine valley I ever saw was not in the Alps, it was the valley Norangsdalen at
Sunnmøre, Norway, said famous English mountain climber _

William C. Slingsby (1848-1929) after one of his many
visits to the area.

We started
our trip from the picturesque jugend town Ålesund and sailed in to
Hjørundfjorden on the last day of April. Cloudless skies and a light breeze
accompanied us in to the depth of the fjord. Three hours later we where
securely tied up at an old ferry pier at Store Standal. There are a couple of
houses there but all you really see is the mountains that surround the 400
meter deep fjord. The evening was spent dreaming of what mountain to ski down
the next day. 

Two
experienced mountain guides where ready on the pier when we woke up.

The first
summit was Kolåstinden 1432 meters over the fjord.
The trip started with easy walking on trails before it was time to get the skies on.
After five hours of walking we finally reached the summit and the ride back down
gave us a taste of what to come in the next few days. 

Day two started with light rain and the guide suggested an easy 3-4 hours
trip up to Fingeren (The Finger) right above the famous lodge on Standal. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f43449cf-ef9e-4a55-9ace-3c26add7597c.JPG)

The accent was fairly easy. 

We rounded
the day of by sailing even deeper in to the fjord. On our way we almost sailed
under a waterfall and then went for the stone pier at Urke in the north end of
Norangsfjorden. Day 3
was the day to get exhausted. The trip started with the skies on the shoulder
and a 2 kilometer walk up to the first snow. Then there was a 6 hour hard trek
up to the summit on Slogen (1564). The last few meters to the top are very
exposed and the skies have to be carried. But the reward was a magnificent view
of the Sunnmøre Alps, and the downhill run with skies right from the top. The
after ski beer on Hotel Union Øye, built in 1881, left us breathless. The boat
waited on the floating dock just a short walk from the Hotel.Day 4 we
went for a rather easy trip up and down Skårasalen and where picked up on the
beach by Explore Norths dinghy. When we
headed out of the Hjørundfjord we could only smile and hope to get back. And we will
because the trip left me with so good memories that I have decided to give it a
go as a way of life. From 09 we will use our knowledge, the boat, love for the
nature and sea to take people in to the Norwegian mountains. You can say the
trip -- and the boat -- changed my life.
