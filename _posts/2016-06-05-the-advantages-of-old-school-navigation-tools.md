  Bill Biewenga discusses his favorite manual navigation tools. Originally
  published in BWS January 2016 I'm scrambling. With one and a half days before
  I fly to France for another transatlantic passage, I'm deeply immersed in the
  process of procuring a new battery for an old Iridium phone, collecting the
  correct Navionics chips for our eventual landfall in North America and
  initializing and authorizing my new InReach tracking and messaging device.
