Sail to Svalbard is the most comprehensive guide for those who want to sail to sail to Svalbard on their own keel. The author has extensive high latitude sailing experience and has also dived in to how to prepare for high latitude sailing in general and Svalbard in particular.

The book also describes 96 anchorages and harbors in the archipelago.

Explorer [Mikael Strandberg][1]: "Most of all, it is a book about Svalbard and full of great info, superb maps and details on what is needed for a visit outside Longyearbyen. ThereÂ´s many good photos and it should be standard reading for anyone who wants to sail to Svalbard."

You can buy it as Kindle from Amazon [here][2], or email jon@explorenorth.no for a print edition.
