If you are dreaming of cruising in the high latitudes, it's time to do something about it. Explore North can provide you with advice and assistance based on personal experience that will help you be prepared both mentally and equipment wise to live your dream.

We have detailed knowledge of the area above the polar circle and have partners and associates that have managed expeditions in areas such as Antarctica, North West Passage, North East Passage and Greenland.

Through the years we in Explore North have collected a wealth of experience in sailing in colder climates. We have equipped and refitted boats, planed and executed long voyages in rough sub zero climates, provisioned expeditions, provided weather and ice routing, arranged crew and skippers and come back home to tell the story.
